 * One stage of a group replacement as the tool of the AI assistant sends it: a name and, if the model
 * chose one, a colour.
 *
 * There is no identifier here, and that is the whole contract rather than an omission - the schema of
 * the tool has none either
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\Integration\AiAssistant\Tools\CategoryUpdateStagesList}), which is what leaves
 * {@see MatchByPosition} nothing to match a stage by but its place in the list. {@see StageInput}
 * would take an identifier and this strategy would ignore it, so the two contracts stay two types.
 *
 * A `null` colour is the absence of one rather than a value: the stage keeps the colour it has, and a
 * stage that has none is given the next colour of
 * {@see \Bitrix\Crm\Stage\DefaultProcessColorGenerator}.
