/**
 * The strategy of the AI assistant tool: a stage is the same one when it stands in the same place.
 *
 * The tool has no identifiers in its contract at all
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\Integration\AiAssistant\Tools\CategoryUpdateStagesList}), so the n-th stage the
 * model sends becomes the n-th stage of the category the replacement owns, whatever that stage used
 * to be called. What the list does not reach is deleted, what it is longer than the category by is
 * created in front of the first final stage, and the final stages themselves are left where they are.
 *
 * This is the pass the AI scenario used to run itself
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\Integration\AI\Function\Category\Stage\UpdateList}), moved here as it is: the
 * matching is a tool a model already talks to, so it is kept exactly - including the workaround of
 * {@see self::match()} below, which is the one thing here that does not follow from the domain.
 * Anything that looks like a bug in it is a product decision and a task of its own, never a fix made
 * in passing. What surrounds the pass did change on the way, and the scenario lists it.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches storage or permissions: input in, plan out.
 *
