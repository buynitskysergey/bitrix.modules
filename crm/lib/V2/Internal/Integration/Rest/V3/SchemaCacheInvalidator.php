/**
 * Keeps the cached REST schema in step with the composition of the entity types of the portal.
 *
 * The schema is built whole and cached whole, so without this a smart process would wait out the
 * cache before its methods answered, and a deleted one would leave dead routes behind. The events of
 * the type table are the single place every such change goes through, so that is where the calls
 * come from.
 *
 * Of a type row only the capability flags shape the schema: {@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Public\EntityTypeSettings}
 * reads nothing else off it, and both the routes of an entity type
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Infrastructure\Rest\CustomController\Category\RouteBuilder}) and the fields of
 * its DTO ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Infrastructure\Rest\Dto\Item\ItemDtoGenerator}) are derived from those
 * settings alone. Dropping the schema is a `cleanDir` over the cache of every module, so renaming a
 * type or any other save of its row must not pay for it.
 *
 * Only the schema is dropped here. The composition of the types themselves lives in another cache
 * with its own invalidation, which the type events do on their own before calling in.
