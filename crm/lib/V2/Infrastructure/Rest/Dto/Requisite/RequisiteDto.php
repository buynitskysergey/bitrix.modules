/**
 * The external contract of a requisite of a CRM contact or company, as the administrative read of the
 * whole portal publishes it.
 *
 * The list of properties is not a decision of this class: which column of `b_crm_requisite` is published,
 * under which name and with which of the two attributes was settled by the field revision the method was
 * published under, column by column. A field added here on its own is a breach of that contract - a
 * published field can never be removed.
 *
 * The property names are the field names of
 * {@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Internal\Entity\Requisite\Requisite} one to one, so nothing is renamed between the
 * storage-facing read and the answer.
 *
 * No property carries {@see \Bitrix\Rest\V3\Attribute\Editable}: the only method behind this contract
 * reads. `Filterable` and `Sortable` are closed lists that start narrow - widening them later is
 * compatible, narrowing them is not. Only `id` and `ownerId` are sortable: every other column lacks an
 * index leading with it, and an ordering by one of them would order the whole table.
 *
 * `presetId`, `identificationTypeId` and `taxRegimeId` publish references to CRM dictionaries REST 3.0
 * offers no way to list yet. That is a known departure from the regulation rather than an omission.
