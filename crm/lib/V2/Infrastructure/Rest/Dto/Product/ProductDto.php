/**
 * The external contract of a card of the CRM product catalog - the catalogue entry, not its use inside
 * an Item. The fields of a product row (owner, quantity, discount) are absent because a card has none
 * of them.
 *
 * An explicit list of properties rather than a projection of the storage: a card is stitched together
 * from an element of the CRM catalog iblock and what the catalog module keeps about it, and a projection
 * of either would publish their internals. Deliberately left out and not by omission: the announce and detail
 * pictures, the way the description is stored (`DESCRIPTION_TYPE` - a storage detail, not a property of
 * a product), and the iblock properties. A published field can never be removed, so the list starts
 * narrow; widening it later is compatible, narrowing it is not.
 *
 * No property carries {@see \Bitrix\Rest\V3\Attribute\Editable}: the only method behind this contract
 * reads.
 *
 * `Filterable` and `Sortable` are closed lists and are the same lists
 * {@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Internal\Repository\Product\ProductRepository} can answer for - the property
 * names of this class are the field names of {@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Internal\Entity\Product\ProductCard}
 * one to one, so nothing is renamed on the way in or out. Any ordering is settled by the primary key.
 *
 * `vatId` publishes a reference to a VAT rate while v3 offers no way to list the allowed rates yet.
 * That is a known departure from the regulation, the same one `measureCode` of a product row carries.
