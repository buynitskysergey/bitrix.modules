/**
 * The external contract of a stage of a category (pipeline).
 *
 * The same contract answers a read and carries a write of the single-stage methods. Unlike a
 * category, a stage looks the same whatever the entity type it belongs to, so there is no generator
 * behind this class: the routes of the family name it directly.
 *
 * `stageId` is always the whole identifier, the entity type prefix among it - `C2:NEW` for a Deal
 * category, `DT128_5:NEW` for a smart process one. The forms storage keeps inside itself
 * (`DEAL_STAGE_5`, an identifier without a prefix) are none of a client's business and never reach
 * here. It is read-only: which stage a write means is said by the identifier of the request rather
 * than by a field of it.
 *
 * `categoryId` says which category a stage is added to, and `0` is one of its real values - the
 * default category of Deal. It is not written on an update: a stage does not move between
 * categories. The framework does not enforce that on its own - a field declared required in any
 * group skips the editable check altogether ({@see \Bitrix\Rest\V3\Dto\DtoValidatorHelper}) - so an
 * update sending it is for the controller of the family to refuse.
 *
 * Nothing here is sortable and `categoryId` alone is filterable: the stage provider of the domain
 * reads the stages of one category in the order they stand in and takes neither a filter nor a sort,
 * so publishing either would promise what the scenario does not do. The category is the exception
 * because it is not a filter at all but the address of the set - the list of stages requires it
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Crm\V2\Infrastructure\Rest\Request\Category\Stage\ListStageRequest}), and a filter
 * is where the regulation puts the parent of a list.
 *
 * The name the documentation knows this contract by is spelled out rather than taken from the class:
 * a schema is named after the module and the short class name
 * ({@see \Bitrix\Rest\V3\Dto\Dto::getTypeName()}), and `Bitrix\Crm\V2\Infrastructure\Rest\Dto\Item\
 * Common\Dictionary\StageDto` - the stage of an item, a different contract altogether - already
 * answers to `bitrix.crm.stagedto`. Without the alias one of the two would publish the other's fields.
