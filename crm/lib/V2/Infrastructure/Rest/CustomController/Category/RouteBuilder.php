 * the family cannot be a static list: it is built from the actual composition of the types. A method
 * exists only where the capability behind it does - the category methods where the entity type has
 * categories, the stage methods where it has stages as well - rather than being registered
 * everywhere and answering with an error at runtime.
 *
 * Building this walks the types of the portal, which is affordable exactly because the schema is
 * built whole and cached whole ({@see \Bitrix\Rest\V3\Schema\ControllerDataManager}). The walk reads
 * the map of types that is already cached for a day and touches
 * {@see EntityTypeSettings::of()} once per type; nothing here may grow into a query per type.
