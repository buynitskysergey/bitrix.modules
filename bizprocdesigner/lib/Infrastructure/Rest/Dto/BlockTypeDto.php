/**
 * Block of the agent-facing catalog: the single resource behind listing the catalog and reading one
 * block of it.
 *
 * There is no separate detail resource, because BlockTypeDetail is itself a composition around
 * BlockType: reading a block answers with the same resource, flat, with the detail parts filled in.
 * In the listing they stay uninitialized and are absent from the payload instead of weighing every
 * catalog entry down with empty keys.
 *
 * Property order mirrors the domain: BlockType::toArray() first, then the remaining keys of
 * BlockTypeDetail::toArray(). The whole resource is read-only - the agent reads the catalog, never
 * writes it.
