 * Single problem of a validated graph (DTO-02).

 * The reader is an external agent, not an end user: the message is the domain validator's own text and
 * stays as it is.
 *
 * blockId and code are nullable rather than conditionally emitted: a problem the validator could not
 * bind to a block, or a message no error class has been extracted for yet, still answers with the key
 * carrying null, so the agent may read all four fields of every issue unconditionally.
