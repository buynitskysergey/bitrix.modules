/**
 * Collects the rows of mailboxes that are not in the database anymore.
 *
 * The deletion of a mailbox is the only path that takes those rows away, it runs once, and it
 * cannot be repeated: by the time anyone could notice that it left something behind, the mailbox
 * row itself is gone and with it every trace of what was unfinished. So the leftovers are found
 * by a condition that needs no bookkeeping of its own - the owner of the row is not there - and
 * every statement below carries that condition itself. Two things follow, and they are the reason
 * this agent exists at all: the sweep is safe to repeat any number of times, and it cannot touch
 * a mailbox that is alive, whatever the walk over the ids believes about it.
 *
 * The cursor of the walk travels in the name of the agent, the way the other cursor carrying
 * agents of the module do it. A lap that reaches the last id starts over: an id already passed
 * holds rows again only if a mailbox of that id is deleted, and the next lap meets it.
 *
 * The ids of a lap are the ids the swept tables hold rows of, and almost every one of them
 * belongs to a mailbox that is alive - an installation that never lost a deletion halfway has
 * nothing else. So the ids of a run are collected first and asked about their owners in one
 * statement, and only the ones the database answers for as ownerless are swept. Without that
 * step a run of a healthy installation spent a listing of letters and a series of deletes that
 * were bound to match nothing on every living mailbox it walked past.
