/**
 * The fallback route of the recognition: the letters the tail append stage puts onto a
 * source that answers no coordinates to an append.
 *
 * The main route needs nothing of this. A source that reports APPENDUID names the folder
 * epoch and the number it gave the letter, so the stage computes the placement row of it
 * and writes a terminal verdict straight into the matching journal - the reverse read then
 * stops at that verdict without comparing anything ({@see TailAppendService}). Some servers
 * report no such pair, and for a letter of theirs there is nothing a verdict could be
 * addressed by: the coordinates are what addresses it, and they are never learned.
 *
 * So such a letter carries a mark of ours instead - random, one time, and readable back out
 * of the MIME. What the mark is NOT is the decision: the identity comes from the row this
 * service writes BEFORE the letter reaches the server, and a mark with no row leads nowhere.
 * The order is the whole of it, and it is the same order the stage keeps everywhere else:
 * write down what is about to happen, then let it happen.
 *
 * The mark is not stored. What the row keeps is MARK_HASH, the SHA-256 of it in hex, the way
 * the fingerprints of the matching keep their values: a reader of the database learns which
 * letters have a mark and never which mark, so it cannot compose a letter that claims one.
 *
 * Where it differs from the two headers the module already has:
 *
 * - The header of the send path (X-Bitrix-Mail-Message-UID) carries an open and guessable
 *   placement row id, is read in any run of any synchronization and any folder, and its
 *   handling REWRITES the row it names. This mark is random, is read only inside the
 *   declared operation ({@see Context::acceptsTailMark()}) and leads to a new placement
 *   being linked, never to an old one being rewritten.
 * - The transferable identifier of a managed transfer service arrives from outside and is
 *   written by code that is not ours, which is why a match by it still has to be confirmed
 *   by the comparison of the letters. The ground of trust here is a different one: we wrote
 *   the record down before the letter existed on that server.
 *
 * The residual risk remains explicit rather than covered: the mark lies
 * physically inside a letter in the mailbox of the client, so whoever already has access to
 * that mailbox can read it and put a letter of their own carrying the same mark there before
 * we read ours back. The lifetime below is what bounds the window it is worth trying in.
