 *  - unfiltered: the mailbox pointer is 0 (not backfilled yet, or the G1 walk is
 *    still in progress and its rows are split between 0 and the G1 id);
 *  - active(P): pointer P > 0, reads cover IN (0, P) - rows with the implicit 0
 *    are written only by generation-unaware code and always belong to the active
 *    source, the backfill adopts them later;
 *  - exact(G): one concrete generation (e.g. the PREPARING G2 of a migration
 *    import), strictly isolated from every other generation;
 *  - withoutPreparedGenerations(mailbox): every generation the mailbox has really
 *    served - the active one and the ones retained by earlier switches - and none
 *    of the ones it is preparing. A read-only shape {@see getStampGenerationId()}.
