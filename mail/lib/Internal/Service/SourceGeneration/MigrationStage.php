/**
 * The observable stages of one physical source migration of a mailbox.
 *
 * The three first cases repeat the states of the shared G1 initializer
 * ({@see BackfillService}) by value, so a state of the initializer converts into a
 * stage without a mapping table. Everything from PreparingG2 on belongs to the
 * migration operation itself and is stored with the prepared generation, so a
 * failure keeps the stage and the next run of the same operation continues from it.
 *
 * TailAppend stands between the import and the switch, and the order is the whole
 * reason it works ({@see TailAppendService}): it reaches the old source for the
 * attachments while that source is still the active one, and it leaves the appended
 * letters to the delta pass of ReadyToSwitch. Without the source system's authorization,
 * the completed tail stops at AwaitingSwitchAuthorization; the authorization command
 * moves it to ReadyToSwitch, whose repeatable passes walk every folder of the new source
 * before the route of the delivery moves.
 *
 * ResettingImport is the one stage that goes backwards: a source that changed the epoch
 * of a folder is taking back its promise that the numbers of it mean the same letters, so
 * everything the import of the generation created is dropped and the import starts over
 * ({@see MigrationService::resetImportedData()}). It is a stage of its own because the
 * drop is bounded like every other pass and therefore may end unfinished: while it stands
 * here, the operation goes nowhere near the switch.
