/**
 * The letters the active source delivered while the transfer was already deciding about them.
 *
 * The matching answers by the fingerprints of the local history, and that history keeps growing
 * under it: the main load of the import holds no sync lock of the mailbox, so the active source
 * goes on delivering - with its filters, its event, its CRM activity and its notifications - and
 * a letter delivered after the fingerprints of a pass were completed carries none of them yet.
 * The import then finds no candidate for the copy of that very letter on the new source, writes
 * down a terminal NEW and creates a second logical record of it. That record is what the user
 * would see after the switch: the same letter, without the CRM activity, the calendar event and
 * the chat of the one they were notified about. Nothing else links the two copies - the header
 * hash of the old synchronization cannot: it is taken over the header block together with the
 * stamp the server put on the letter and its size on the wire, and two sources agree on none of
 * the three.
 *
 * This pass takes such a decision back, and it runs where the boundary with the delivery is
 * finally consistent: inside the hand over, under the sync lock, after the final synchronization
 * of the active source and after the fingerprints have been completed over everything it
 * delivered {@see MigrationService::handOver()}.
 *
 * The walk goes over the letters of the mailbox and not over the journal of the import, and that
 * is the whole reason its cursor can be trusted. Message ids only grow, so a letter delivered
 * between two attempts of a hand over lands beyond every page already walked and is met by the
 * next one. Walking the journal instead would leave exactly the opposite: a decision the cursor
 * has already passed, about a letter that arrived afterwards, would never be looked at again.
 *
 * Only a NEW decision that found no candidate at all is reconsidered, and only for a letter no
 * AMBIGUOUS decision of this generation names. An ambiguous refusal saw its candidates and
 * refused them deliberately; it is never overruled here, where there is less to go on than the
 * import had.
 *
 * Nothing is merged by content and no binding is ever moved: the placements of the prepared
 * generation start serving the delivered letter, and the record the import created - which
 * carries no binding of anyone, because an import publishes no delivery effect - is dropped.
