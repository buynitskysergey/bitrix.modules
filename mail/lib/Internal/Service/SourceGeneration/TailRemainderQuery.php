/**
 * The remainder of a transfer: letters the retained generation still holds a live
 * placement of while the prepared one holds none.
 *
 * The transfer service copies the mail of the mailbox from one server to the other on
 * its own and does not carry all of it over. A letter it left behind disappears from
 * the mailbox the moment the prepared generation starts serving it, and its
 * attachments become unreachable for good. This is the enumeration of exactly those
 * letters, in the order the append stage has to work through them: first the ones a
 * CRM activity or a task points at, then the rest.
 *
 * Two passes with a cursor of their own instead of one sorted walk. The bindings live
 * in b_mail_message_access, whose index leads with the message, so the priority of a
 * letter is answered for a page of message ids and never sorted over the whole
 * remainder - and a mailbox has no index that would order the bindings of a mailbox
 * by the letter they point at.
 *
 * The answer is placements alone: a letter this stage has already appended stays in
 * the remainder until the reverse synchronization registers its placement of the
 * prepared generation. What has been appended already is the question of the write
 * ahead record of the stage, not of this enumeration.
