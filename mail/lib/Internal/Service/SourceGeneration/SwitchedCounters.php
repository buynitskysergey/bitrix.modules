/**
 * The stored unread counters of a mailbox right after it changed hands (ALG-02).
 *
 * Every counter of the module is a number counted once and stored, and the placements it was
 * counted over belong to a generation: the final synchronization of the retained source runs
 * moments before the switch, so the numbers it stored describe a source the user no longer
 * has. The counter of a folder is the exception - a folder row carries its own generation and
 * every reading path restricts itself to the active one, so those rows tell the generations
 * apart by themselves. The mailbox counter, the global badge summed from it and the counters
 * of the labels have no generation of their own and would keep answering for the retained
 * source until the next synchronization, the labels until a binding of theirs changes.
 *
 * They are recounted here rather than dropped: a dropped counter reads as a zero, which is a
 * wrong number as well, and the recount is a handful of queries over rows already stored - the
 * switch stays as instant as it was. Nothing here talks to the mail server: the counters of the
 * folders of the new source come from its first synchronization, as they always have.
