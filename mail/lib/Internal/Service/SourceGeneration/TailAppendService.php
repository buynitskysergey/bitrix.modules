/**
 * The second half of a transfer: the letters the external service failed to carry over,
 * put onto the new source by the module itself.
 *
 * The service copies the mail of the mailbox from one server to the other on its own and
 * does not carry all of it over. A letter it left behind has a placement of the retained
 * generation and none of the prepared one: the moment the prepared generation starts
 * serving the mailbox, that letter is gone from the list, from the search and from the
 * thread, and its attachments are gone for good - a download through a placement of a
 * generation the mailbox has left is refused by the boundary. The deal in CRM survives the
 * move and keeps the text of a letter whose files nobody can open again.
 *
 * So the stage stands between the import and the switch, and both neighbours matter. The
 * old source is still the active one, which is the only reason the attachments can still be
 * downloaded; and the delta pass of the switch walks every folder of the new source
 * afterwards, which is what reads the appended letters back - this stage writes no
 * placement of its own.
 *
 * The order of one letter is the whole of its safety: the attachments are downloaded and so
 * is the body of a letter our own row kept as an envelope alone, the message is assembled,
 * the intent to append it is written down, only then does it go up, and the verdict of the
 * matching follows immediately. What the write ahead buys is the resumption: a pass that
 * dies between the append and the verdict left a letter on the server that our journal
 * knows nothing about, and the next pass has to find that out before it appends the same
 * letter a second time.
 *
 * What it cannot buy is a verdict written before the append. The verdict is addressed by
 * the coordinates the server assigns to the letter, and the server assigns them in the
 * answer to the append itself - there is nothing to address a verdict with beforehand.
 * The gap is named, not hidden: a letter that fell into it is read back by the ordinary
 * route of the matching, and the route survives it because the assembled copy carries the
 * text part out of our own column instead of a retelling of the markup
 * ({@see TailMessageBuilder}).
 *
 * The cursor of the walk is the one thing that must never run ahead of the letters: it
 * moves past a letter only once that letter is on the new source, and what counts as being
 * there is a proof - a terminal record of its mark, a verdict of the journal, the folder
 * answering that it holds the mark of this very append, or the window of numbers the letter
 * would have landed in. When none of the four can answer, the fallback is defined in one place
 * ({@see UNKNOWN_APPEND_LANDED}).
 *
 * A source that refuses the letter, a source that will not hand its files over and a storage
 * that will not keep them are a different thing: there the letter is known NOT to be up
 * there, so it stays current and the pass ends with it. What the next passes are for is
 * telling apart the two things that look alike from here. One letter the source will not
 * take - one above the size limit of the server, one whose file is gone - is set aside once
 * the attempts of the module are out on it ({@see HistorySyncAttemptService}) and the walk
 * goes on over the rest of the remainder: a letter nobody can append must not cost the
 * mailbox the hundreds of letters behind it. A source that takes letter after letter from nobody is the other thing
 * ({@see SOURCE_REFUSALS}), and there walking on would leave the remainder in the archived
 * generation for nothing, so the operation stops by name (ERROR_TAIL_SOURCE_REFUSES) instead.
 *
 * A set aside letter is never dropped in silence: it is counted apart
 * ({@see MigrationMetrics::SET_ASIDE}) and named in the log of the portal one by one, exactly
 * as the letters the switch leaves behind past the window of the stage.
 *
 * A source that hands no BODY over is not among them: that letter has no files to lose, its
 * body may be gone for good, and a remainder waiting on it would cost the mailbox its whole
 * tail - so the envelope goes up and the loss is counted
 * ({@see MigrationMetrics::ENVELOPE_ONLY}).
 *
 * A source that answers no coordinates at all leaves every letter of the remainder in that
 * gap, and there the ordinary route is not good enough - a mailbox whose whole tail comes
 * back as new letters is the harm this stage exists against. Such a letter therefore carries
 * a one time mark of ours, written down before the append and readable back out of the MIME
 * ({@see TailMarkService}). Only such a letter does: a letter whose coordinates we learn has
 * the stronger route already, and a mark put into it would stay inside the mailbox of the
 * client for nothing. Which of the two a source is worth is learned from its first answer,
 * so the first letter of the very first pass against such a source is the one letter left in
 * the gap - and the answer is remembered with the generation, so no later pass repeats it.
