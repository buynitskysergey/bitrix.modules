 * through, and it is bounded by a budget and not by a moment: it walks the folders of the new
 * source and may be minutes away from its end. So the deletion can neither simply outwait it
 * nor give up on it - a mailbox the user asked to delete must not stay half deleted. It asks
 * the operation to stop, and it lets the last of its own cleanups wait for the answer.
